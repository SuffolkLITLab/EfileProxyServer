# Tyler ECF 5 Java Code

This module contains java code [generated by `wsdl2java`](../docs/wsdl2java.md) from the
[Electronic Court Filing v5 standard](https://docs.oasis-open.org/legalxml-courtfiling/ecf/v5.0/ecf-v5.0.html)
WSDL and XML schema files.

This module contains interfaces and implementations of some Major Design Elements (MDEs) from ECF 5:

* Court Record MDE
* Filing Assembly MDE, for this server to receive notifications from the court regarding filings.
* [Filing Assembly MDE](src/main/java/https/docs_oasis_open_org/legalxml_courtfiling/ns/v5_0/wsdl/filingassemblymde/FilingAssemblyMDE.java) for actually creating filings into cases in a court.
* Service MDE for serving notices to other parties in your case electronically.
* [Court Scheduling MDE](src/main/java/https/docs_oasis_open_org/legalxml_courtfiling/ns/v5_0/wsdl/courtschedulingmde/CourtSchedulingMDE_Service.java)

All other files include the data types that are passed to the interfaces present on these MDEs.

## Difference between this and generated code

* edited javadocs to be able to be compliant (i.e. `&` to `&amp;`, other HTML encoding issues). No substantive changes.
