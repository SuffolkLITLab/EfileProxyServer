# Tyler ECF 4 Java Code

This module contains java code (mostly) [generated by `wsdl2java`](../docs/wsdl2java.md) from the
[Electronic Court Filing v4 standard](https://docs.oasis-open.org/legalxml-courtfiling/specs/ecf/v4.0/ecf-v4.0-spec/ecf-v4.0-spec.html)
WSDL and XML schema files, published by Tyler Technologies in their implementation.

This module contains interfaces and implementations of the following Major Design Elements (MDEs):

* [Court Record MDE](src/main/java/oasis/names/tc/legalxml_courtfiling/wsdl/webservicesprofile_definitions_4_0/CourtRecordMDEPort.java) ([Court Record implementation](src/main/java/tyler/efm/wsdl/webservicesprofile_implementation_4_0/CourtRecordMDEService.java)),
    for querying the court about case information that it currently knows about.
* [Filing Assembly MDE](src/main/java/oasis/names/tc/legalxml_courtfiling/wsdl/webservicesprofile_definitions_4_0/FilingAssemblyMDEPort.java) ([Assembly implementation](src/main/java/tyler/efm/wsdl/webservicesprofile_implementation_4_0/FilingAssemblyMDEService.java)),
    for this server to receive notifications from the court regarding filings.
* [Filing Review MDE](src/main/java/oasis/names/tc/legalxml_courtfiling/wsdl/webservicesprofile_definitions_4_0/FilingReviewMDEPort.java) ([Review implementation](src/main/java/tyler/efm/wsdl/webservicesprofile_implementation_4_0/FilingReviewMDEService.java)),
    for actually creating filings into cases in a court.
* [Service MDE](src/main/java/oasis/names/tc/legalxml_courtfiling/wsdl/webservicesprofile_definitions_4_0/ServiceMDEPort.java) ([service implementation](src/main/java/tyler/efm/wsdl/webservicesprofile_implementation_4_0/ServiceMDEService.java))
    for serving notices to other parties in your case electronically.

All other files include the data types that are passed to the interfaces present on these MDEs.

TODO(brycew): the WSDLs / XMLs themselves are still in the `proxyserver` module: they will
eventually be moved to here however.

## Difference between this and generated code

* edited javadocs to be able to be compliant (i.e. `&` to `&amp;`, other HTML encoding issues). No substantive changes.
